Banker's Algorithm and Deadlock Visualization
This project is a web-based application built using Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to demonstrate the Banker's Algorithm, visualize the Wait-for Graph, detect deadlocks, and compute a safe sequence for resource allocation in operating systems. It provides an interactive and educational tool to understand process scheduling and deadlock avoidance.

Features
Banker's Algorithm Implementation: Simulates resource allocation and ensures a safe state by determining a safe sequence of processes.
Wait-for Graph Visualization: Displays a graphical representation of resource dependencies between processes.
Deadlock Detection: Identifies potential deadlocks in the system based on resource allocation and requests.
Safe Sequence Output: Provides a sequence of processes that can execute without causing a deadlock.
Interactive UI: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a user-friendly experience.


Technologies Used
Python: Core logic for the Banker's Algorithm and deadlock detection.
HTML: Structure of the webpage.
CSS: Styling for a clean and responsive design.
JavaScript: Dynamic visualization and interactivity on the client side.
How It Works
Input the number of processes and resources.
Specify the allocation, maximum need, and available resources.
The system processes the data using the Banker's Algorithm.
Visualize the Wait-for Graph and check for deadlocks.
Display the safe sequence (if one exists) or indicate a deadlock.
